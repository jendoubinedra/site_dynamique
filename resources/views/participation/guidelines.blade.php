   <h3>Oral Presentations</h3>
    <p>Regarding oral presentations (i.e. papers included in sessions, special sessions and
        student contest sessions), the slot for each paper is 15 minutes (10-12 minutes for presentation and 3-5 minutes for questions). A computer with PDF reader
        and Microsoft PowerPoint will be available. All presenters should pass their presentations to
       the technical staff, present in each room, using their own external storage devices during the break
    or lunch before the sessions, in which their presentations are included.</p>
    <h3 class=" mb-2">Poster Presentations</h3>
    <p>The required poster size is A0, portrait orientation. Poster authors are expected to present their
        posters to the scientific community at the dedicated poster sessions. Lunch and coffee breaks could
        also be opportunities to present the posters. Please take the opportunity to read other posters and
         exchange contact information. Poster presenters may want to have
        A4 copies of their posters and their business cards available for distribution.</p>
    <h3 class=" mb-2">Poster Mounting</h3>
    <p> All posters shall be mounted ahead of the poster session. Materials for mounting posters will be provided at
        the poster session venue. Please check that your poster is located on the correct board. Your poster number
        is the same to the number of your submission (see Program). The list of poster numbers will be also
        available in the conference room. Posters shall be dismounted by the end of the day, those that
         have not been removed will be disposed-off.
    </p>
    <h3 class=" mb-2">Printing your poster in Heraklion</h3>
